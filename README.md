# Code-Clash
"Would you rather" game but for code

This is now both frontend and backend.

## Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Django, with PostgreSQL for database

## To do list (I'll move this to Asana soon(tm))
- General:
    - Move routing to backend
    - Setup Docker?
- Frontend:
    - Real, consistent design
    - Redux maybe
    - Write a setup guide for new devs
- Backend:
    - Implement a better algorithm for randomly getting the codes
    - Use Jun's authentication thingy to set up logging in with Utorid
        - Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/junthehacker/Identity-Atheneum#register-your-app)
